The reason for this increase is due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies agreeing to continue with plans to ease supply curbs through July. This decision is expected to boost oil prices, as it indicates that demand for oil is recovering. Additionally, the slowdown in talks between the United States and Iran over Tehran\\'s nuclear programme has reduced expectations of a rise in Iranian oil supply, further supporting oil prices. The news is positive for oil investors, as it suggests that oil prices will continue to rise in the near future.'}"

dow also eased from record levels on the first trading day of the year as president donald trump travels to georgia in a bid to keep the US senate in the hands of his republican party. OPEC and allies, a group known as OPEC+, were meeting on monday. most OPEC+ officials voiced opposition to increasing oil output from february when they met on sunday, three OPEC+ sources told reuters. OPEC+ increased output by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month but some members have questioned the need to increase more from february due to an upsurge in the Covid-19 pandemic.\\', \\'MOSCOW/LONDON OPEC+ resumes debate on tuesday after talks stumbled over february policy, as russia led calls for higher output while others suggested holding or even cutting production due to new lockdowns.debate resumes at 1430 GMT after the group, which combines OPEC and other producers including russia, failed to find a compromise on Monday.OPEC+ sources told reuters that russia and kazakhstan backed raising production by 0.5 million bpd while iraq, nigeria and the united arab emirates suggested holding output steady.an internal OPEC document, seen by reuters on tuesday and dated jan. 4, suggested a 0.5 million bpd cut in february as part of several scenarios considered for 2021.the document also said that the OPEC+ joint ministerial committee highlighted bearish risks and \"stressed that the reimplementation of COVID-19 containment measures across continents, including full lockdowns, are dampening the oil demand rebound in 2021\".on monday, saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman said OPEC+ should be cautious, despite a generally optimistic market environment, as demand for fuels remained fragile and variants of the coronavirus were unpredictable.new variants of the coronavirus were first reported in britain and south africa and have since been found in countries across the world.with benchmark brent oil futures holding above $50 per barrel, OPEC+ took the opportunity this month to raise output by 0.5 million bpd as it looks to eventually ease cuts that currently stand at 7.2 million bpd.OPEC+ producers have been curbing output to support prices and reduce oversupply since january 2017 and cut a record 9.7 million bpd in mid-2020 as COVID-19 hammered demand for gasoline and aviation fuel.\\', \\'LONDON the members of the OPEC group of oil producing countries and their allies will continue talks on tuesday, a day after they adjourned without reaching a deal on february production levels.Twenty-three countries in total are trying to reach a compromise between whose who favour keeping in place current cuts to production levels because of market uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic, and those who favour releasing an extra 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) onto the market next month.the two heavyweights among the producers gathering on tuesday, saudi arabia and russia, are on opposing sides of the debate, with riyadh urging caution and moscow keen to boost production.tuesday video-conference meeting is expect to restart at 1430 GMT and is part of a more regular schedule of monthly meetings brought about because of price volatility in the wake of the pandemic.demand for crude cratered under the effects of the virus in 2020 and oil producing nations have been trying to adjust their output accordingly in order to support prices.the last OPEC+ last videoconference summit, held from november 30 to december 3, \"paved the way for a gradual return of 2 million barrels per day to the market over the coming months\" in the words of OPEC general secretary mohammed barkindo, while leaving room for adjustments in reaction to market movements.the first step to implementing that agreement was an increase in 500,000 bpd in january with a commitment to meeting at the beginning of each month to set production levels for the following month.disagreements on the way forward are nothing new for the OPEC+ grouping, which now faces the added challenge of trying to factor in a pandemic which shows no sign of abating and a vaccination campaign which has got off to a slower than hoped for start in some regions.prices for both north sea brent crude and west texas intermediate (WTI), which are often sensitive to OPEC+ discussions, were stable in early trading on tuesday at around $50 a barrel.\\']\\nUrls: [\\'https://www.brecorder.com/news/40047761/opec-resumes-talks-amid-divide-on-february-oil-output-levels\\', \\'https://tribune.com.pk/story/2278671/oil-falls-despite-opec-keeping-output-steady\\', \\'https://www.brecorder.com/news/40047729/opec-resumes-talks-after-february-split-on-oil-output\\', \\'https://www.brecorder.com/news/40047680/opec-to-continue-talks-for-deal-on-february-production\\']\\nBold_KW: [\\'brent, , \\']\\nFeature: [\\'reduce oversupply\\', \\'oil prices fell\\', \\'reduce oversupply\\', \\'cuts to production level\\']\\nFeatureSentiment: [\\'neg\\', \\'neg\\', \\'neg\\', \\'neg\\']\\nPrice: 111.64\\nScalings: [-0.49, -5.33, -0.49, -2.74]\\nEvents_Impact: -2.26\\nEMA55_Signal: 0\\nEMA9_Signal: 2\\nMACD_Signals: 3\\nRSI_Signals: 0\\nTrading_Recommendations: {\\n  \"Trading Recommendation\": \"Buy\",\\n  \"Rationale\": \"The market signal indicates a buy opportunity.
